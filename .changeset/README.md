# Change files

Every pull request that changes a package adds a Markdown file to this
directory. Knope reads the files to choose the next version, write
`CHANGELOG.md` and open the release pull request. Merging that pull request
publishes both packages. The files are deleted when the release is prepared.

Create one with `knope document-change` (the dev shell provides `knope`), or
write it by hand:

```markdown
---
default: minor
---

# Add `Angle.wrapSigned`

Optional detail in Markdown below the heading. It becomes the changelog entry.
```

`default` is the only package name because both NuGet packages share one
version. The type is `major`, `minor` or `patch`. While the version is below
1.0, `major` bumps the middle number and both `minor` and `patch` bump the last
one, so breaking changes stay visible in the version.
